**Abstract:**
Steganography is the method of hiding a message signal in a cover signal, while minimizing any distortion of the cover signal and increasing the capacity. Steganography can be used to hide information in the cover items such as images, videos, sounds files, text files, while in transmission.

In image steganography field, one of the major concerns and desirability is to how to improve the capacity of hidden information in the host image
without causing any statistically measurable changes and artifacts.

In this project report we used a mix column transform method to increase the security, capacity and preserve imperceptibility of the cover image. Our method was the combination of steganography and cryptography which results in more security against attack.
