This project is about cricket world. You can search for players and their related stats. Another stage of this project allow user to predict the winning chances of a team in a match.
Last stage of the project will be image classifier.

Right now it is in development phase.

Dataset in use : https://www.kaggle.com/seshadri95/odi-players-year-wise-batting-stats

This dataset doesn't contain all the attributes required for the match win predictor, so, I'll scrap the related data from different sports website to enrich the data further.
